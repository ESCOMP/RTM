River Transport Model
=====================

The River Transport Model, RTM, is part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM).
It is managed by the Land Model Working Group (LMWG) as a part of CESM.

See the CESM web site for documentation and information:

**IMPORTANT NOTE: RTM is only used for Paleo work -- use MOSART or mizuRoute otherwise**

RTM is part of CESM3, but it's only supported use is for Paleo
work, and other uses should use MOSART.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: RTM's planned successor is mizuRoute**

Longer term RTM will be removed in future versions of CESM and the new model
mizuRoute will be used for Paleo work.
