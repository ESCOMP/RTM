=====================
River Transport Model
=====================

The River Transport Model, RTM, is part of the Community Earth System Model.

IMPORTANT NOTE: RTM is Obsolescent!

RTM is part of CESM3, but is obsolescent. It's only supported use is for Paleo
work, and other uses should use MOSART.

Longer term RTM will be removed in future versions of CESM and the new model
mizuRoute will be used for Paleo work.
